# DHCP Lab

Date: February 26, 2026
Topic: DHCP Configuration
Stage: Stage 1 — Beginner
Status: ✅ Completed

## What I Built
Configured router as DHCP server for 3 department
network. PCs automatically get IP addresses without
manual configuration.

## Network Layout
IT Department  → 192.168.1.0/26
Office Staff   → 192.168.1.64/26
Management     → 192.168.1.128/26

## DHCP Pools Configured

ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.1.129 192.168.1.138

# IT Department pool
ip dhcp pool IT-DEPARTMENT
network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.192

## PC IP Addresses Received

IT Department
- PC0: 192.168.1.12 (automatic)
- PC1: 192.168.1.11 (automatic)

Office Staff
- PC2: 192.168.1.75 (automatic)
- PC3: 192.168.1.76 (automatic)

Management
- PC4: 192.168.1.139 (automatic)
- PC5: 192.168.1.140 (automatic)

## Test Results
- Ping same department:    Success ✅
- Ping different department: Success ✅

## What I Learned
- DHCP automatically gives IP addresses to devices
- DORA process: Discover, Offer, Request, Acknowledge
- DHCP pool is range of IPs server can give out
- Excluded addresses reserved for special devices
- Router can act as DHCP server for small networks
- DHCP gives first available IP regardless of PC order
