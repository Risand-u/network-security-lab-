# Subnetting Lab

## What I Built
Company network with 3 departments each
with their own subnet using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Network Layout
IT Department  → 192.168.1.0/26   (62 devices)
Office Staff   → 192.168.1.64/26  (62 devices)
Management     → 192.168.1.128/26 (62 devices)

## IP Addresses Used
IT Department
- Router: 192.168.1.1
- PC1:   192.168.1.2
- PC2:   192.168.1.3

Office Staff
- Router: 192.168.1.65
- PC3:    192.168.1.66
- PC4:    192.168.1.67

Management
- Router: 192.168.1.129
- PC5:    192.168.1.130
- PC6:    192.168.1.131

## Router Commands Used
int gig0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.192
no shutdown

int gig0/1
ip address 192.168.1.65 255.255.255.192
no shutdown

int gig0/2
ip address 192.168.1.129 255.255.255.192
no shutdown

## What I Learned
- How to divide one big network into smaller subnets
- /26 gives 62 usable devices per subnet
- Router connects all subnets together
- Switches need no configuration for basic connectivity

## Tests Performed
- Pinged PC1 to PC2 same subnet - Success
- Pinged PC1 to PC3 different subnet - Success
- Pinged PC1 to PC5 different subnet - Success
